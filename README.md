# Travel-App
This app allows user to search for their travel destination and plan a perfect trip to their dream place.
# Approach
1) My approach for this app was making it user friendly as much as possible.
2) Implemented a Recommended section that allows user to get through the most visited destination.
3) Implemented a tour packages section that helps user to plan their trip according to their budget.
4) Shown the ratings of the places to make it easy for the user to review the destination they want to visit.
# Challenges Faced
1) Designed an intuitive UI that allows users to easily navigate and use the app.
2) Give Shadow under the Recommended section.
# Improvements
1) Add more features like updating the user about weather forecasts, round-about trip Fare, currency exchange rates, about Tour guides and Travel agencies.
2) Change the recommended section as per user's choice.
3) Add filter option according to users destination choices and needs.
4) Add fare and discount options to attract more users.
